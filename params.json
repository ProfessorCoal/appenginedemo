The program will run \"out of the box\" on Google App Engine, Google's popular\r\nand easy to use cloud computing platform, and unless you expect a really high volume of submissions\r\nshould easily run within Google's free quota for the service.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n===============\r\n\r\n* Create a new App Engine project and local working directory for your project\r\n* Copy the files into the directory\r\n* Open main.py, and insert your API key in the variable api_key\r\n* Open app.yaml and change the application name (in the first line in the config file) to your project name or ID\r\n* Deploy the code to App Engine, and open the url https://your_app_name_or_id.appspot.com\r\n\r\nThat's all there is to it. If you have any questions, submit a support ticket at https://support.insight.ly",
